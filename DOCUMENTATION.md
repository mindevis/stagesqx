# ProgressiveStages - Complete Documentation

## Overview

ProgressiveStages is a NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that provides **stage-based progression locks** for modpack developers.

You define *stages* in TOML files, then ProgressiveStages:
- grants/revokes stages to players (or teams)
- blocks items/blocks/recipes/dimensions until stages are unlocked
- integrates with EMI for visual feedback (lock icons, overlays)
- optionally integrates with **FTB Quests** so Stage Tasks update immediately when stages change

---

## v1.2 Changes

### Dependency Graph (replaces linear order)
- **Removed:** `order` field in stage definitions
- **Added:** `dependency` field for explicit stage dependencies
- Stages can have zero, one, or multiple dependencies
- Dependencies are validated on load (missing/circular dependencies logged)

### Admin Bypass with Confirmation
When granting a stage with missing dependencies:
```
/stage grant Player diamond_age
→ "Cannot grant diamond_age: Player is missing dependency 'iron_age'. Type command again to bypass."

/stage grant Player diamond_age
→ Stage granted (bypassed dependency check)
```
Confirmation expires after 10 seconds.

### Multiple Starting Stages
Config now supports granting multiple stages on first join:
```toml
[general]
starting_stages = ["stone_age", "tutorial_complete", "spawn_protection"]
```

### Unlocked Items (Whitelist Exceptions)
New field to always allow specific items, even if broader locks apply:
```toml
[locks]
mods = ["mekanism"]  # Lock all Mekanism items
unlocked_items = ["mekanism:basic_universal_cable"]  # Except this one
```

### Entity Locks
Lock entity types to prevent attacking them until a stage is unlocked:
```toml
[locks]
entities = ["minecraft:warden"]
entity_tags = ["#minecraft:raiders"]
entity_mods = ["mekanism"]  # Lock all entities from a mod
```
Note: Using `mods = ["modid"]` also locks entities from that mod (cascade behavior).

### Unlocked Entities (Whitelist Exceptions)
New field to always allow attacking specific entities, even if broader locks apply:
```toml
[locks]
mods = ["mekanism"]  # Locks items, blocks, AND entities
unlocked_entities = ["mekanism:robit"]  # But allow attacking robits
```

---

## Core Concepts

### What is a Stage?
A stage is an ID like:
- `stone_age`
- `progressivestages:diamond_age`
- `progressivestages:tech/iron_age` (hierarchical)

Stages are server-authoritative and stored per **team** (FTB Teams mode) or per **player** (solo mode).

### Stage ID Normalization (Matches Minecraft ResourceLocation Rules)
Stage IDs are normalized (so admins/configs are harder to mess up):

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Whitespace trimmed | `"  iron_age  "` → `"iron_age"` |
| Lowercased | `"Diamond_Age"` → `"diamond_age"` |
| Default namespace added | `"iron_age"` → `"progressivestages:iron_age"` |
| Namespaced preserved | `"mymod:my_stage"` → `"mymod:my_stage"` |
| Hierarchical paths allowed | `"tech/iron_age"` → `"progressivestages:tech/iron_age"` |

**Allowed characters** (aligned with Minecraft/NeoForge resource IDs):
- **Namespace:** `a-z 0-9 _ - .`
- **Path:** `a-z 0-9 _ - . /`

Disallowed examples:
- `Iron Age` (spaces)
- `Stage#1` (special chars)
- `/iron_age` or `iron_age/` (leading/trailing slash)
- `tech//iron_age` (double slash)

---

## Stage Files

### Location
Stage files live in the **global config directory**:

```
config/ProgressiveStages/*.toml
```

That means stages apply to all worlds on that server/instance (not per-save).

### Stage File Format (v1.4)
```toml
[stage]
# Required
id = "iron_age"

# Optional (UI)
display_name = "Iron Age"
description = "Iron tools and basic machinery"
icon = "minecraft:iron_pickaxe"
unlock_message = "&6Iron Age Unlocked!"

# Dependency (v1.2) - stages that must be unlocked BEFORE this one
# Single dependency:
dependency = "stone_age"

# OR multiple dependencies (list format):
# dependency = ["stone_age", "tutorial_complete"]

# OR no dependency (omit field) - can be granted anytime

[locks]
# Items (direct IDs)
items = [
  "minecraft:iron_pickaxe",
  "minecraft:iron_sword"
]

# Item tags (tag keys)
item_tags = [
  "#c:ingots/iron"
]

# Item mods (lock all items from a mod, NOT blocks/entities)
# Use this when you only want to lock items from a mod
item_mods = [
  "mekanism"  # Locks all Mekanism items, but NOT blocks or entities
]

# Recipe Items (v1.4) — lock the RECIPE only, NOT the item itself
# Players CAN pick up, hold, and use the item (e.g., from loot chests).
# Players CANNOT craft the item (recipe is hidden in EMI/JEI).
# Tooltip shows "🔒 Recipe Locked" instead of "🔒 Item Locked".
recipe_items = [
  "minecraft:diamond_pickaxe",  # Can't craft, but can use if found in loot
  "minecraft:enchanting_table"
]

# Name patterns (case-insensitive substring matching)
names = [
  "diamond",  # Locks minecraft:diamond, minecraft:diamond_pickaxe, etc.
  "netherite" # Locks all netherite items
]

# Block mods (lock all blocks from a mod, NOT items/entities)
# Use this when you only want to lock blocks from a mod
block_mods = [
  "mekanism"  # Locks all Mekanism blocks, but NOT items or entities
]

# Mod locks (lock ALL content from a mod: items, blocks, entities, AND fluids)
# NOTE: Using mods = ["modid"] locks EVERYTHING from that mod.
# For finer control, use item_mods, block_mods, entity_mods, or fluid_mods separately.
mods = [
  "create"  # Locks all items, blocks, entities, AND fluids from the Create mod
]

# Blocks
blocks = [
  "minecraft:iron_block"
]

# Block tags
block_tags = [
  "#minecraft:logs"
]

# Dimensions
dimensions = [
  "minecraft:the_nether"
]

# Fluids (v1.4) — EMI/JEI visibility ONLY (does NOT block fluid transport)
fluids = ["mekanism:heavy_water"]
fluid_tags = ["#c:acids"]
fluid_mods = ["mekanism"]

# Entities (v1.1) - Lock entity types (prevent attacking)
entities = [
  "minecraft:warden",       # Can't attack wardens until this stage
  "minecraft:elder_guardian" # Can't attack elder guardians
]

# Entity tags (v1.1) - Lock all entity types in a tag
entity_tags = [
  "#minecraft:raiders"  # Can't attack any raiders
]

# Entity mods (v1.1) - Lock all entities from a mod
# NOTE: entity_mods is ONLY for entity attacks. Use this when you want to lock
# entities separately from items. If you use mods = ["modid"], entities are 
# automatically locked as well (no need to also specify entity_mods).
entity_mods = [
  "mekanism"  # Can't attack any Mekanism entities
]

# Unlocked items (v1.2) - Whitelist exceptions
# These items are ALWAYS accessible, even if broader locks apply
# Use case: Lock entire mod but allow specific items
unlocked_items = [
  "mekanism:basic_universal_cable",  # Allow this even though mekanism is locked
  "minecraft:diamond_horse_armor"    # Allow this even though "diamond" name pattern is locked
]

# Unlocked blocks (v1.4) - Whitelist exceptions for blocks
unlocked_blocks = [
  "ae2:charger"  # Allow even if ae2 is locked via mods
]

# Unlocked entities (v1.2) - Whitelist exceptions for entities
# These entities can ALWAYS be attacked, even if broader entity locks apply
# Use case: Lock entire mod entities but allow attacking specific ones
unlocked_entities = [
  "mekanism:robit",  # Allow attacking robits even though mekanism entities are locked
  "minecraft:zombie" # Allow attacking zombies even if locked via tag/pattern
]

# Unlocked fluids (v1.4) - Whitelist exceptions for fluids (EMI/JEI)
unlocked_fluids = [
  "mekanism:hydrogen"  # Show in EMI even though mekanism is locked
]
```

### Per-Stage Enforcement Exceptions (v1.4)

Each stage file can include an `[enforcement]` section that exempts specific items from global enforcement rules. The item remains "locked" (shows lock icon, requires the stage) but the specific enforcement action is allowed.

Each list accepts three formats:
- **Item IDs:** `"minecraft:diamond_pickaxe"`
- **Item tags:** `"#c:gems/diamond"`
- **Mod IDs:** `"mekanism"` (matches ALL items from that mod)

```toml
[enforcement]

# Items that can be USED (right-click, left-click, mine, attack) even when locked
allowed_use = [
  "minecraft:diamond_ore",
  "minecraft:deepslate_diamond_ore"
]

# Items that can be PICKED UP from the ground even when locked
allowed_pickup = [
  "minecraft:diamond",
  "#c:gems/diamond"
]

# Items that can remain in the HOTBAR even when locked
allowed_hotbar = [
  "minecraft:diamond"
]

# Items that can be MOVED with mouse in GUIs even when locked
# (allows storing items in chests even though they're locked)
allowed_mouse_pickup = [
  "minecraft:diamond",
  "minecraft:diamond_ore"
]

# Items that can remain in INVENTORY even when locked (won't be auto-dropped)
allowed_inventory = [
  "minecraft:diamond",
  "minecraft:diamond_ore",
  "minecraft:deepslate_diamond_ore"
]
```

**Use case:** Lock diamond items globally but allow players to pick up and store raw diamonds so they can stockpile them for when they unlock the stage.

> ⚠️ These exceptions only apply when the corresponding global enforcement setting is enabled in `progressivestages.toml` (e.g., `block_item_use = true`). If a global enforcement is disabled, exceptions have no effect.

### Notes
- `stage.id` can be bare (`iron_age`) or namespaced (`progressivestages:iron_age`). Both work.
- All stage IDs are normalized (trimmed/lowercased) when loaded.
- v1.2: The `order` field is **removed**. Use `dependency` instead.

### Lock Cascade Behavior

The following table shows which content types are locked by each lock type:

| Lock Type | Items | Blocks | Entities | Fluids (EMI/JEI) | Recipes |
|-----------|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:-------:|
| `mods = ["modid"]` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `item_mods = ["modid"]` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `block_mods = ["modid"]` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `entity_mods = ["modid"]` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `fluid_mods = ["modid"]` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `names = ["pattern"]` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `items = [...]` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅* |
| `blocks = [...]` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `entities = [...]` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `fluids = [...]` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `recipe_items = [...]` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

\* When an item is locked via `items = [...]`, its recipe is also implicitly locked.

**Key Points:**
- **`mods = ["modid"]`** is the "lock everything" option — locks all items, blocks, entities, AND fluids from that mod.
- **`names = ["pattern"]`** locks **everything** containing that pattern — items, blocks, entities, AND fluids.
- **`recipe_items = [...]`** locks **only the crafting recipe** — the item itself remains fully usable (can be picked up, held, and used from loot).
- **Fluid locks only affect EMI/JEI visibility.** They do NOT prevent players from piping, pumping, or using fluids in machines. To block fluid transport, you need to lock the machines/pipes themselves.

### Recipe-Only Locks (`recipe_items`) vs Item Locks (`items`)

| Behavior | `items = [...]` | `recipe_items = [...]` |
|----------|:---------------:|:---------------------:|
| Can pick up item | ❌ | ✅ |
| Can hold in inventory | ❌ | ✅ |
| Can use item (right/left click) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Can craft item | ❌ | ❌ |
| Visible in EMI | ❌ (hidden) | ✅ (visible) |
| Recipe visible in EMI | ❌ (hidden) | ❌ (hidden) |
| Tooltip text | "🔒 Item Locked" | "🔒 Recipe Locked" |
| Both applied | — | "🔒 Item and Recipe Locked" |

**Use case:** Allow players to use items found in loot chests or mob drops, but prevent crafting until the stage is unlocked. Perfect for progression-gated gear.

### Whitelist Exceptions
Each content type has its own whitelist that takes priority over ALL lock types:

| Whitelist | Exempts |
|-----------|---------|
| `unlocked_items = [...]` | Items from `mods`, `item_mods`, `item_tags`, `names` |
| `unlocked_blocks = [...]` | Blocks from `mods`, `block_mods`, `block_tags`, `names` |
| `unlocked_entities = [...]` | Entities from `mods`, `entity_mods`, `entity_tags`, `names` |
| `unlocked_fluids = [...]` | Fluids from `mods`, `fluid_mods`, `fluid_tags`, `names` |

**Example:** Lock all Mekanism items but allow the configurator:
```toml
[locks]
mods = ["mekanism"]
unlocked_items = ["mekanism:configurator"]
```

---

## Configuration

Config file:
```
config/progressivestages.toml
```

The authoritative list of config keys is in `StageConfig.java`.

### General (v1.2)
```toml
[general]
# Multiple starting stages (v1.2)
starting_stages = ["stone_age", "tutorial_complete"]

# Or single stage
starting_stages = ["stone_age"]

# Or no starting stages
starting_stages = []

team_mode = "ftb_teams" # or "solo"
debug_logging = false

# If true: granting a stage also grants all missing dependencies recursively.
# If false: stages require explicit dependency satisfaction.
#   - Admin commands will prompt for confirmation to bypass missing dependencies.
#   - Automatic grants (triggers, rewards) will fail silently if dependencies are missing.
linear_progression = false
```

### Enforcement
```toml
[enforcement]
block_item_use = true
block_item_pickup = true

# Soft item restriction options (v1.4):
# These provide a friendlier alternative to block_item_inventory.
# When block_item_inventory = false, these let you fine-tune what players
# can do with locked items. Useful for modpacks where players can find
# locked items in loot chests and store them for later use.

# Prevent locked items from being in the hotbar.
# Items are moved to main inventory (not dropped).
# Ignored if block_item_inventory = true.
block_item_hotbar = true

# Prevent picking up locked items with the mouse cursor in GUIs.
# When false, players can freely move locked items to chests.
# Ignored if block_item_inventory = true.
block_item_mouse_pickup = true

# Strictest option: auto-drop locked items from entire inventory.
# If true, overrides block_item_hotbar and block_item_mouse_pickup.
block_item_inventory = true
inventory_scan_frequency = 20
block_crafting = true
hide_locked_recipe_output = true
block_block_placement = true
block_block_interaction = true
block_dimension_travel = true
block_locked_mods = true
block_interactions = true
block_entity_attack = true  # Block attacking locked entity types

# Bypass checks when player is in creative mode
allow_creative_bypass = true

# Optional identity hiding
mask_locked_item_names = true

# Chat spam protection
notification_cooldown = 3000
show_lock_message = true

# Sound feedback
play_lock_sound = true
lock_sound = "minecraft:block.note_block.pling"
lock_sound_volume = 1.0
lock_sound_pitch = 1.0
```

### EMI
```toml
[emi]
enabled = true
show_lock_icon = true
lock_icon_position = "top_left"
lock_icon_size = 8
show_highlight = true
highlight_color = "0x50FFAA40"
show_tooltip = true

# If false: hide locked stacks from EMI index/search
# If true: show them (with lock icon/overlays depending on context)
show_locked_recipes = false
```

### Integration: FTB Teams
```toml
[integration.ftbteams]
# Enable/disable FTB Teams integration entirely.
# If false, ProgressiveStages will NOT load any FTB Teams classes at all.
# Falls back to solo mode automatically.
# Default: true (but gracefully degrades if FTB Teams is not installed)
enabled = true
```

### Integration: FTB Quests
```toml
[integration.ftbquests]
enabled = true
recheck_budget_per_tick = 10
```

## Commands

### Stage Commands
| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/stage grant <player> <stage>` | OP | Grant a stage |
| `/stage revoke <player> <stage>` | OP | Revoke a stage |
| `/stage list [player]` | OP | List stages |
| `/stage check <player> <stage>` | OP | Check if player has stage |
| `/stage info <stage>` | OP | Show stage definition info |

### Admin Commands
| Command | Permission | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| `/progressivestages reload` | OP | Reload stage + trigger configs |
| `/progressivestages validate` | OP | Validate stage files (syntax + IDs) |
| `/progressivestages ftb status [player]` | OP | Debug FTB integration |
| `/progressivestages trigger reset <player> <dimension|boss> <key>` | OP | Reset one-time trigger |

### FTB Integration Status Command
`/progressivestages ftb status [player]` prints helpful diagnostics:
- whether integration is enabled in config
- whether ProgressiveStages registered as the StageHelper provider
- whether compat is active
- pending rechecks count and budget
- whether a previous provider was stored (dev/debug)
- for a player: stage count + list + whether a recheck is currently in progress

---

## Trigger System

Triggers grant stages based on events (no per-tick polling required for triggers).

### File
```
config/ProgressiveStages/triggers.toml
```

### Stage IDs in triggers
Both are equivalent:
```toml
[advancements]
"minecraft:story/mine_stone" = "stone_age"
"minecraft:story/smelt_iron" = "progressivestages:iron_age"
```

### Trigger Types

#### Advancements
```toml
[advancements]
"minecraft:story/mine_stone" = "stone_age"
"minecraft:story/mine_diamond" = "diamond_age"
```

#### Item Pickup
```toml
[items]
"minecraft:iron_ingot" = "iron_age"
"minecraft:diamond" = "diamond_age"
```
Also performs a **login inventory scan** to catch players who already have the item.

#### Dimension Entry (one-time)
```toml
[dimensions]
"minecraft:the_nether" = "nether_explorer"
```

#### Boss Kills (one-time)
```toml
[bosses]
"minecraft:ender_dragon" = "dragon_slayer"
```

### Trigger Persistence
Dimension and boss triggers are **one-time** per player:
- persisted in `world/data/progressivestages_triggers.dat` (anchored to overworld storage)
- survives restarts
- won’t re-trigger even if a stage is later revoked

Admin reset:
```
/progressivestages trigger reset <player> dimension minecraft:the_nether
/progressivestages trigger reset <player> boss minecraft:ender_dragon
```

---

## EMI Integration (Visual Feedback)

### What EMI shows
ProgressiveStages provides client-side lock feedback:
- Lock icon overlay on locked stacks (depending on UI context)
- Highlight overlay (configured) for locked recipe components
- Optional tooltip info

### Hiding vs showing locked content
Controlled by:
- `emi.show_locked_recipes`

Behavior:
- `false`: locked stacks are hidden from EMI index/search (so they don’t clutter discovery)
- `true`: locked stacks may appear, but are visually marked as locked

### Important note about “stage tags” in EMI
ProgressiveStages **does not** register custom tags via EMI’s registry API (EMI doesn’t support that).

If you want to search using `#progressivestages:...` style tags, that must come from the **NeoForge tag system** (datapack tags). If/when this mod generates tags, EMI will automatically pick them up.

---

## FTB Quests Integration

ProgressiveStages can act as the **StageHelper provider** used by FTB Quests Stage Tasks.

### How it works
1. ProgressiveStages registers as `StageHelper.INSTANCE` provider (FTB Library)
2. When a stage changes, ProgressiveStages queues a "stage recheck" for the player
3. FTB Quests `StageTask.checkStages(ServerPlayer)` is called (debounced + budgeted)

### Using Stage Rewards in FTB Quests
FTB Quests can grant ProgressiveStages stages as quest rewards:

1. Create a quest in FTB Quests
2. Add a **Stage Reward** to the quest
3. Set the stage ID (e.g., `iron_age` or `progressivestages:iron_age`)
4. When the player claims the reward, ProgressiveStages grants the stage

**Note:** Stage IDs are normalized automatically. Both `iron_age` and `progressivestages:iron_age` work.

### Hiding Quest Chapters/Pages Behind Stages

#### Method 1: Native "Stage Required" Field (Recommended)
ProgressiveStages adds a **"Stage Required"** field directly to Quest and Chapter properties via mixins:

1. Open FTB Quests in **Edit Mode**
2. Select a **Quest** or **Chapter**
3. Right-click → **Properties**
4. Find the **Visibility** section
5. Enter a stage ID in **"Stage Required"** (e.g., `diamond_age` or `progressivestages:iron_age`)
6. Leave empty for no requirement

**How it works:**
- If the field is empty or blank, the quest/chapter is visible to all
- If a stage ID is set, the quest/chapter is hidden until the player unlocks that stage
- Stage IDs are normalized automatically (handles case differences, extra whitespace)
- Data is saved/synced with FTB Quests' normal save system

**Note:** This requires FTB Quests to be installed. The mixins only load when FTB Quests is present.

#### Method 2: Stage Task Dependency (Alternative)
For more complex requirements, use FTB Quests' native Stage Task:

1. Create a hidden "gate quest" with a Stage Task
2. Make the locked quest/chapter depend on the gate quest

This method works for requiring multiple stages or combining with other task types.

### Performance guardrails
- Coalesces multiple stage changes into 1 recheck per player per tick
- Recheck budget: `integration.ftbquests.recheck_budget_per_tick`
- Re-entrancy guard prevents recursive loops (quest reward → stage grant → recheck)

### Soft-disable behavior
If compatibility breaks (FTB API changes), ProgressiveStages:
- logs a clear error
- keeps core locks/EMI working
- only FTB stage-task integration is affected

---

## Enforcement System (Locks)

### Item enforcement
Depending on config, ProgressiveStages can:
- block item use (right-click, left-click, mine, attack)
- block pickup from the ground
- block holding in hotbar (moves item to main inventory; drops if full)
- block picking up with mouse cursor in GUIs (prevents moving in containers)
- block holding in inventory (auto-drops locked items)
- block crafting (clears recipe output for locked items)

### Soft Enforcement (v1.4) — `block_item_hotbar` and `block_item_mouse_pickup`
These provide a friendlier alternative to `block_item_inventory`:

| Config Key | What it does | Ignored if |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `block_item_hotbar` | Moves locked items out of hotbar to main inventory (drops if full) | `block_item_inventory = true` |
| `block_item_mouse_pickup` | Prevents picking up locked items with mouse in GUIs | `block_item_inventory = true` |
| `block_item_inventory` | Strictest: auto-drops locked items from entire inventory | — |

**Use case:** Set `block_item_inventory = false`, `block_item_hotbar = true`, and `block_item_mouse_pickup = false` to let players store locked items in chests for later use, but prevent equipping them.

### Recipe enforcement
- `block_crafting = true` — Prevents crafting locked items (clears result slot)
- `hide_locked_recipe_output = true` — Hides the output item in crafting grid
- Works with both `items = [...]` (item + recipe locked) and `recipe_items = [...]` (recipe-only lock)

### Block enforcement
Depending on config, ProgressiveStages can:
- block placement
- block interaction

### Creative bypass
If `enforcement.allow_creative_bypass = true`, creative mode players bypass enforcement.

### Mask locked item names
If `enforcement.mask_locked_item_names = true`, locked items show as **"Unknown Item"** to the client.

### Per-Stage Enforcement Exceptions (v1.4)
Each stage file can include an `[enforcement]` section to exempt specific items from global enforcement. See [Per-Stage Enforcement Exceptions](#per-stage-enforcement-exceptions-v15) in the Stage Files section for details.

---

## Networking & Client Caches

ProgressiveStages syncs:
- stage state → `ClientStageCache`
- lock registry → `ClientLockCache`

Sync strategy:
- snapshot on join
- deltas on grant/revoke

---

## Public API (Mod Integration)

Package:
```
com.enviouse.progressivestages.common.api
```

### ProgressiveStagesAPI
```java
boolean has = ProgressiveStagesAPI.hasStage(player, StageId.parse("iron_age"));
ProgressiveStagesAPI.grantStage(player, StageId.parse("diamond_age"), StageCause.QUEST_REWARD);
ProgressiveStagesAPI.revokeStage(player, StageId.parse("stone_age"), StageCause.COMMAND);
Set<StageId> stages = ProgressiveStagesAPI.getStages(player);
```

### Events
```java
@SubscribeEvent
public static void onStageChanged(StageChangeEvent event) {
    // event.getPlayer(), event.getStageId(), event.getChangeType(), event.getCause()
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Build / Startup
- If you see compile errors around EMI tag APIs: this mod does not (and should not) call non-existent EMI registry methods.
- If you update FTB mods and stage tasks stop updating: run `/progressivestages ftb status` to inspect provider registration and compat.

### Stage Required field not appearing (FTB Quests)
**Problem:** The "Stage Required" field doesn't show in quest/chapter properties.

**Cause:** FTB Quests isn't installed, or the optional ProgressiveStages FTB Quests mixins failed to load.

**Solution:**
1. Verify FTB Quests is installed (check mods list for `ftb-quests`)
2. Check client logs for mixin errors mentioning `progressivestages-ftbquests.mixins.json`
3. Verify your FTB Quests version is compatible (tested with `ftb-quests-neoforge-2101.1.21`)

**Workaround:** Use a Stage Task dependency instead.

### EMI issues
**Locked items not hiding:**
- Set `emi.show_locked_recipes = false`
- Re-open inventory to trigger EMI refresh

**Lock icon missing:**
- Ensure `emi.show_lock_icon = true`
- Confirm texture exists: `assets/progressivestages/textures/gui/lock_icon.png`

### Triggers don't fire
- Confirm the stage ID exists (use `/stage info <stage>`)
- Confirm triggers.toml formatting
- For dimensions/bosses: if it already triggered once, use `/progressivestages trigger reset ...`

### Reload behavior
**What `/progressivestages reload` does:**
- Reloads stage files (*.toml) from config/ProgressiveStages/
- Reloads triggers.toml
- Re-syncs lock data to all online clients
- Triggers EMI refresh on clients

**What it does NOT do:**
- Clear one-time trigger history (dimension/boss triggers that already fired)
- To reset triggers, use `/progressivestages trigger reset <player> <type> <key>`

### Known limitations
- **Stage Required field requires FTB Quests:** If you open the game without FTB Quests installed, the field won't exist and any saved requirement is effectively ignored.
- **Name pattern lock performance:** `names = ["diamond"]` style locks require iterating all registered items to resolve matches. In very large modpacks (10k+ items), this can add ~50-100ms during server lock resolution. Prefer exact item IDs when possible.

### FTB Quests stage tasks not completing
- Run `/progressivestages ftb status <player>`
- Verify:
  - Config Enabled: YES
  - Provider Registered: YES
  - Compat Active: YES
